This module installs a view helper for generating links to static resources that reside on a subdomain (e.g. http://static.mydomain.com/images/image.jpg).


Usage (within a view script):
<?php echo $this->staticLink('my_picture.jpg', Application\View\Helper\StaticLink::IMAGE, array('profiles', 'admins')); ?>

Output:
http://static.mydomain.com/images/profiles/admins/my_picture.jpg


The first parameter is the name of the file to create a link to.
The second parameter is the name of the subfolder (optional). This will usually use one of the constants defined within the view helper class.
The third parameter is an array of subdirectories to include between the subfolder and file name.
